## Introduction
This repo contains the source code for a Powershell Self Documenting Library. If you've ever had a ton of powershell scripts and wanted to know about them at a glance, be able to sort through them, and look at logs all from one place. This is the project for you.

## Setup:
* Install [PoshServer](http://poshserver.net)
* Git Clone Scripty into the PoshServer http directory.
* Open up your webserver and point it to http://localhost:8080/scripty/ or whatever your server ip and port is.
